# Dicoding Submission : Creating a Bookshelf App
**The Bookshelf App is the final assignment project of the [Belajar Membuat Front-End Web untuk Pemula](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/315) course from Dicoding.com, with the Front-End learning path. *The app is made in a form of a website with the ability to manage data using DOM and Web Storage.*** The Website allows users to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using Javascript by adding book data from the book form and switching the data between current reading books, finished books, and top favorite books. The website then adds events to create interactivity on the HTML elements. The website uses the API browser to store book data in web storage, particularly local web storage.

## Implementations and Improvements
### 📌 Home Page and Book Form
On the top of the website is a navigation bar where the position remains fixed and does not interfere with scrolling behavior.

The home page includes a book form to add books to the library. The form constructs the input for the Title, Author, and Year as required. Furthermore, users can provide additional information about the book's category, cover image, and rating.
Add book to the library
