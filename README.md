# Dicoding Submission : Creating a Bookshelf App
**The Bookshelf App is the final assignment project of the [Belajar Membuat Front-End Web untuk Pemula](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/315) course from Dicoding.com, with the Front-End learning path. *The app is made in a form of website with the ability to manage data using DOM and Web Storage.*** The Website allows users to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using Javascript by adding book data from the book form and switching the data between current reading books, finished books, and top favorite books. The website then adds events to create interactivity on the HTML elements. The website uses the API browser to store book data in web storage, particularly local web storage.
